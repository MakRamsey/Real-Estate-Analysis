# Real-Estate-Analysis

For this project we explored and anlyzed a United States real estate listings dataset in order to uncover insights. Data was collected, cleaned, enriched with multiple API interactions and preprocessed ahead of summarization and visualization. Bivariate regression analysis was utilized for a number of input features to determine its impact on listing price repsectively. Specific questions of interest include:

- Given the structure of the database with an “outcome” variable of price and several associated “input” variables, what correlations exist for each input and how much impact do they have on price? Which variable has the largest impact?  How do these correlations compare amongst the geographical areas we chose to analyze? What are the measures of central tendency for pricing in these areas?

  - a)	Number of Bedrooms vs. Price
  - b)	Number of Bathrooms vs. Price
  - c)	Land Size (Acres) vs. Price
  - d)	House Living Space (Sq_Ft) vs. Price
  - e)	City Population vs. Price
  - f)	City Maximum Temperature vs. Price

- Can we create a predictive model to estimate the price of listings based on the above variables?

- What represents an “average” or “typical” house for each state and how do these metrics compare?

- What are some implications we can put forth to an investor, real estate developer and the like given our analysis? Given our selection criteria and specific states studied, where would we suggest a market participant invest and why? Are there any industries outside the real estate market specifically that can glean actionable insight from our analysis?
